# Vite Boilerplate

> Quickly bootstrap a new project with Vite Boilerplate.

This boilerplate contains all the tools you need to build a modern web app with TypeScript, React, Vite and Storybook.  
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your project.

ESLint, stylelint, prettier, husky and lintstaged are configured to give you a solid development experience.

## Installing / Developing

First, [create a repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Now you are ready to go:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies required to run the boilerplate.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Boom! These scripts run your server, client and storybook in development mode.

The default PORTS are:

- `3001` for the client
- `6006` for the storybook

If you don't like to call all scripts at once, you can also run:

```shell
npm run dev
npm run storybook
```

## Building

To build the project, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Tests

A test runner is installed. On GitHub TypeScript, linter and prettier get checked.

## Licensing

MIT
